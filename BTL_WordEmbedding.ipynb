        "\n",
        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "In the field of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, the fundamental challenge lies in translating human language—which consists of discrete, symbolic, and unstructured data—into a format that machine learning algorithms can process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Computers operate on numerical data, specifically vectors and matrices. Therefore, we need a robust mapping function to transform the vocabulary of a language into a vector space.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Semantic Gap\n",
        "The core problem is not merely assigning numbers to words, but preserving **semantic meaning**.\n",
        "* **Traditional approaches** treated words as atomic symbols with no inherent relationship.\n",
        "* **The Result:** The system could not understand that \"laptop\" and \"notebook\" are related.\n",
        "* **The Goal:** Word Embedding bridges this gap by creating a continuous vector space where geometric proximity reflects semantic similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "The advent of dense vector representations has revolutionized the AI landscape. Key applications include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Semantic Search:** Modern search engines use embeddings to understand user intent beyond exact keyword matching (e.g., matching \"cheap hotel\" with \"budget hostel\").\n",
        "* **Machine Translation:** Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems rely on embeddings to map the semantic space of the source language to the target language.\n",
        "* **Recommendation Systems:** Variants like *Item2Vec* treat user sessions as \"sentences\" and items as \"words,\" allowing platforms to recommend items that are mathematically similar.\n",
        "* **Sentiment Analysis:** By capturing the semantic orientation of words, models can better detect sarcasm, nuance, and polarity.\n",

        "2.  **Unsupervised Feature Extraction:** Instead of manual feature engineering, embeddings use **Self-Supervised Learning** to learn from raw text.\n",

Instead, both CBOW and skip-gram learn distributed representations by leveraging the local context in which words appear. The CBOW model predicts a target word based on its surrounding words, effectively aggregating contextual information to infer meaning. Conversely, the skip-gram model predicts the surrounding context words given a single target word, aiming to learn word vectors that are informative enough to generate their typical neighbors in text. Together, these two approaches capture semantic and syntactic regularities by exploiting patterns that naturally occur in large corpora.\n",
